        <h3 class="color-c">The great success of stand up in the 80s was no doubt beneficial. 
            New audiences had been reached and stars had been made.  Comedians had broken through
            into mainstream culture and there was good money to be made.  Success continued into the early 90s and
            few thought that there was anywhere to go but up.

        <h1>The Boom Continues</h1>

        <div class="col5">

            <p>The progress of stand-up in the 80s continued into the early 90s. Sitcoms like Roseanna, 
            Home Improvement and of course, Seinfeld took America by storm.  The though was, that if you
            could find people who were already funny and who already had a dedicated audience, taking them to
            television was going to be a homerun.  Network executives began flooding to the clubs to find the 
            next great voice.  They scoured New York and Boston looking for funny comics in the hopes of developing
            shows around them.
            </p>

            <h3 class="color-c open-box">Perhaps the most fertile feeding ground was the 'Just For Laughs festival in Montreal'.</h3>

            <p>  Networks came with
            full pockets ready to find the funniest people.  Bidding wars rose out of competition for talent.
            By 1996, every major network had at least one sitcom featuring a comedian.  The market became so oversaturated
            that the quality of stand in the clubs and on tv diminshed.  Comics who simply weren't ready for television
            were getting pickedup and dropped so quickly.

            [The networks’] feeling was, 'We're usually hoping actors can be funny. Why not go with people who 
            we already know are funny and then show them how to act?'”

        <div class="col5">

            
            <p>Out of the 80s, comedians had to work 
            hard to eschew genre stereotypes.  A new genre of joke telling arose out of this 
            tumultuous era. Primarily on the west coast, new alternative comics began telling 
            structurally different stories and abandoning the setup punchline form. They appreciate
            monologues and performance versus normal jokes. The comedy is more surreal. Comics like 
            David Cross, Patton Oswalt and Sarah Silverman were all part of this scene.


            <h3 class="color-c open-box" style="clear: both">For the most part, this type of comedy was performed outside of traditional mainstream
                clubs and theaters. 
            </h3>

            <p> Much of this style drew upon character-based and surreal humor.
            This once underground style made its way from the underground to the mainstream. Alt 
            comics became alt stars and comedy became viable and

            <h3 class="color-c">Though there were many great breakthrough's in stand-up and on TV (Chris Rock's "Bring The Pain"
            made him an overnight hit, Seinfeld remains one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time), towards 
            the middle of the 90s, stand-up started to decline.
            </h3>

            <div class="col5">
                <p>The 90s proved too good to be true: as many stand-ups flooded the clubs, talent soon 
                diminished.  Maybe it was too easy to get a gig.  Maybe there were too many people going.
                Partially to blame, the networks incessant funding of young comics no doubt caused many sitcoms to flop.
                The general consensus was that the quality of clubs in the 90s had gone down, and stand-up
                wasn't nearly as cool as it had been in the 80s.  Stand up crashed and burned and no one 
                was sure quite what would come next.
