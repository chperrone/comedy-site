            <h3><span class="color-c">A turning point for stand-up comedy, the 1970’s birthed
                    the idea of the comedy club:</span> a collective place where
                    audiences could come and see stand-ups, as well as a place
                    for comedians to form communities and talk about comedy.

                    <p>The traditional slapstick style was being replaced by a younger, cooler generation who were more interested in fast and loose acts. These comics mixed confessional monologues with raunchy sociopolitical themes. This material spoke to a new generation.  In this way, comedians began breaking down cultural and societal walls and forced minorities and opressed groups to coalese.
                    </p>

                    <p>Across the country comedy clubs sprung up, offering audiences multiple shows every night.  Not only did the proliferation of comedy clubs expose audiences to new comedians, but they also provided new communities for the comics themselves. Stand-up comedians could make 
                    connections with each other; they could see other acts every night and "workshop" their own material.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="color-c open-box">Perhaps one of the most iconic club comedians, George Carlin pioneered stand-up in the 70s and remains, to this day, a legend in stand-up history.
                    </h3>

                    <p>It was for these reasons - and the fact that the new clubs might feature as many as 10 comics
                    in a night - that many comedians weren't being paid by the clubs in the '70s. Clubs were a training ground 
                    and could provide exposure, but weren't financially lucrative for comics.

            <h3>But in 1979, many of the comics who regularly worked at The Comedy Store - tired of 
            working for free while the club made money off them - went on strike. Nearly 150 comedians
            - including both Leno and Letterman - picketed the club for six weeks, demanding to be paid
            for performing.
            </h3>

        <div class="col6">

            <p>The club was able to stay open during the strike because several comics crossed the picket line.
               At the end of six weeks,The owner of the Comedy Store, Mitsy Shore an agreement was reached were
                comics would be paid $25 per set for most shows. This "unionization" of comedians played another
                 huge role in legitimizing stand-up comedy
            in the '70s.

            <p>One particular reporter named Bill Knoedelseder was an LA time reporter
            during the comedy strikes.  In 2009, he released a book called "I'm Dying
            Up Here" which detailed his experience in the comedy strike.  Watch the video below to see some
