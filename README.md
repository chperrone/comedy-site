## Background
The goal of this project is to create a museum-like digital exhibition in the browser showcasing the history and progression of modern standup comedy as well as highlighting notable comics of the era.

The primary goal was to create a sleek design. I wireframed multiple drafts of this site and settled on a flat, retro style with bold contrasting colors and fun UI elements. Buttons are configured to ease in and out on hover. Each era has its own defined color scheme to draw the user through the exhibition. Many large scale photographs and video snippets of notable bits are sprinkled throughout.

In addition to being information rich, the exhibition should offer some interactive elements to allow a user to dive deeper into topics that interest them. I created buttons within each era that allow a user to dive into a specific comedian's history. I also built a secondary view of the exhibition that displays all of the comedians in a grid and allows a user to go straight there if that's what interests them most.

## Development

To host a local php server, run  `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000` in this directory. Then, navigate to that address in a web browser.

## Deploy

A live version of the site is automatically deployed on merges to master to https://modern-comedy.herokuapp.com
