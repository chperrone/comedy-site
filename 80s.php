            <h3 class="color-c">The 1980â€™s ushered a new era of comedy. The success and growth
            of the club scene in America had solidified stand-up as a sought after art form.  In the 1980s,
            the funny business boomed.</h3>

                <p>The '80s also became
                    the decade that stand-up exploded on television. Sitcoms featuring comedians,
                    such as The Cosby Show and Roseanne, became massive hits. And though comics had
                    always been given the opportunity to perform on late-night talk shows (like
                    Johnny Carson'sTonight Show) and variety shows, new programs appeared on TV in
                    the '80s devoted solely to stand-up comedy. The A&E cable network debuted An
                    Evening at the Improv.

                HBO, which came to popularity in the '80s, aired regular
                comedy specials like the HBO Comedy Hour and the Young Comedians Showcase. Even
                MTV started showcasing stand-up comics with its show Half-hour Comedy Hour,
                hosted by comedian Mario Joyner.

            <p>For many comedians, the crossover to TV was very easy - after all, they were actors
                    at heart.  While some comedians broke through in the 80s club scene, for young
                    comics, TV shows and sitcoms were another viable way                         to
                    get noticed in the funny business.  Shows like Roseanne and The Cosby Show were
                    extremely popular in the 80s.  The Cosby Show was a landmark television show,
                    because it was one of the first times a show was based on a comedian's
                    character, rather than a comedian developing a new character for the show.

                     high profile actors and comedians participated in the event by doing short comic routines.
                    The event was aired each year on HBO.
